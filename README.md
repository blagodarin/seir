# Seir

Seir is a toolkit (or a framework, or whatever) for building interactive applications.

Seir aims to be:
* **Easy to start using.**
  Building Seir requires internet connection, [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/),
  recent [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and a supported C++ compiler,
  which is essentially the bare minimum for building modern C++ projects.
  On top of that, you don't even need to build Seir manually in order to use it.
  Some three lines of CMake script will get you Seir with all its dependencies.

### Disclaimer

Seir was created as a vessel for its author's erratic software engineering work.
It may be of use, especially in part, but it may never become a production-ready solution.
No specific features are to be expected, but opening issues is still appreciated.
