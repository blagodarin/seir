# Seir

Seir is a toolkit (or a framework, or whatever) for building interactive applications.

### Disclaimer

Seir was created as a vessel for its author's erratic software engineering work.
It may be of use, especially in part, but it may never become a production-ready solution.
No specific features are to be expected, but opening issues is still appreciated.
